# Ambra1-in-KT-KTC-and-KPTC
Quantitative in vivo analyses for tumor suppressor genes in lung adenocarcinoma

## Overview
The initiation of cell division is a fundamental process that integrates a large number of intra- and extra-cellular inputs. In mammalian cells, D-type cyclins (Cyclin D) couple these inputs to the decision to initiate DNA replication. We describe AMBRA1 as the main regulator of the protein degradation of Cyclin D. AMBRA1 loss promotes lung cancer development in a mouse model and low levels of AMBRA1 correlate with worse survival in lung cancer patients.
